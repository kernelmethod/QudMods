        Wiki reference page: https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Fungal_infections

        Note that the wiki may be out of date as new worms are added and some are tagged/untagged as NoCure.
        An alternative method would be to use a HarmonyPatch on XRLCore.GenerateFungalCure, but this method
        doesn't require any Harmony patching (or even any scripting).
