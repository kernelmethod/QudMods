  "Description": "A Caves of Qud mod that modifies Caves of Qud's save schedule to give a more [i]NetHack[/i]-esque feeling, and make save scumming more difficult.\n\nThis mod makes several changes to Caves of Qud's save schedule so that it saves more frequently, and when the player is in greater peril. It will also automatically delete your save immediately upon character death.\n\nThese changes [i]only[/i] apply in modes that don't have checkpointing (i.e. Classic mode); games played in Roleplay or Wander mode will be unaffected.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/kernelmethod/Iron-Man",
