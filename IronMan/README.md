# Iron Man

A Caves of Qud mod to make save scumming more difficult in Classic mode.

This mod makes several changes to Caves of Qud's save schedule so that it saves
more frequently, and when the player is in greater peril. These changes *only*
apply in Classic mode; games played in Roleplay or Wander mode will be
unaffected.

## Features

Currently, this mod will save the game under the following circumstances:

- Immediately after the player hits zero health
- When the player's health dips below 40%.
