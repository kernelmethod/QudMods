# Precog Secrets

A mod to ensure that learning or forgetting a secret continues after using
Precognition.

Based on an idea by @slimegirls in the Caves of Qud Discord.

**NOTE:** this mod is currently experimental and a little rough around the
edges. Currently, it will only restore one secret learned during precognition.
