# kernelmethod's mods for Caves of Qud

This is the main repository for all of my mods for [Caves of
Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/).

## Installation

The [Caves of Qud
wiki](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Installing_a_mod) has
instructions for installing mods from source code. In general, to install a
given mod you will need to copy a folder from this repository into the correct
directory; for instance, you would install the `EasierFungalCures` mod by
copying the contents of the `EasierFungalCures/EasierFungalCures/` folder.
