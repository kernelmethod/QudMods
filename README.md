# kernelmethod's mods for Caves of Qud

This is the main repository for all of my mods for [Caves of
Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/).

## Installation

The [Caves of Qud
wiki](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Installing_a_mod) has
instructions for installing mods from source code. In general, to install a
given mod you will need to copy a folder from this repository into the correct
directory.

For example, to install the `EasierFungalCures` mod, you should copy the
contents of the `EasierFungalCures/EasierFungalCures/` folder (_just_ the
subfolder, not the parent folder) into your `Mods/` directory. See [file
locations](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/File_locations) on the wiki to find
the location of the mods directory for your operating system. The final
directory structure of this folder in your `Mods/` directory would then look as
follows:

```
Mods
└── EasierFungalCures
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── ObjectBlueprints.xml
    ├── Preview.png
    └── workshop.json
```
